=================

I've written this Symfony application for myself to keep track of my stock portfolio.

It uses my [Yahoo Finance API library](https://github.com/scheb/yahoo-finance-api) to fetch current quotes and
calculates profit / loss from it.

Features
--------

- Add any stock available on Yahoo Finance
- Show daily wins/losses
- Show overall wins/losses
- Add stocks to watch
- Auto and forced refresh on the tabular view
- Privacy feature to hide sensitive information

**Tabular view**
